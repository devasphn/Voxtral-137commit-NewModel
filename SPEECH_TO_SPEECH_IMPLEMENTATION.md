## 🎭 Emotional Intelligence Features

### Emotion Detection
- **Advanced Text Analysis**: Detects emotions from conversation context
- **Multi-Emotion Support**: Happy, excited, empathetic, professional, calm, friendly
- **Contextual Awareness**: Considers conversation history and user emotion

### Voice Selection
- **Automatic Voice Mapping**: Emotions mapped to appropriate Kokoro voices
- **Manual Override**: User can select specific voices or enable auto-selection
- **Voice Characteristics**:
  - `af_heart`: Calm & friendly (default)
  - `af_bella`: Energetic & excited
  - `af_sarah`: Gentle & empathetic
  - `af_nicole`: Professional
  - `af_sky`: Bright & happy

### Speed Adaptation
- **Dynamic Speed Control**: Adjusts speech speed based on content and emotion
- **Content-Aware**: Slower for detailed explanations, faster for urgent content
- **Emotion-Based**: Excited responses slightly faster, empathetic responses slower

## 🌐 User Interface Enhancements

### Speech-to-Speech Mode
- **Mode Selection**: Toggle between text-only and speech-to-speech
- **Voice Controls**: Dropdown selection with emotional descriptions
- **Speed Controls**: Adjustable speech speed (0.8x - 1.2x)
- **Auto-Selection**: Intelligent voice selection based on conversation context

### Real-Time Displays
- **Live Transcription**: Shows what Voxtral understood from user speech
- **AI Response Text**: Displays generated response before speech synthesis
- **Audio Playback**: Built-in audio player with auto-play for AI responses
- **Processing Status**: Real-time pipeline stage indicators
