# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Voxtral + Orpheus TTS integration has critical initialization and architecture issues preventing proper text-to-speech functionality. The system shows "Engine not initialized" errors and fails to generate audio despite having all components installed. This spec addresses the complete integration fix, architecture simplification, and deployment streamlining.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix TTS Engine Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the voice AI system, I want the Orpheus TTS engine to initialize properly on startup, so that text-to-speech functionality works immediately without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the Orpheus TTS engine SHALL initialize automatically
2. WHEN the Orpheus-FastAPI server is running THEN the TTS engine SHALL connect successfully
3. IF the Orpheus server is not available THEN the system SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL log successful TTS engine status
5. WHEN TTS generation is requested THEN the engine SHALL be ready without additional initialization

### Requirement 2: Streamline Architecture and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer using RunPod, I want a single command deployment that starts all services in the correct order, so that I don't need to manage multiple terminals and complex startup sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment script THEN all services SHALL start in the correct dependency order
2. WHEN Orpheus-FastAPI starts THEN the main application SHALL wait for it to be ready
3. WHEN all services are running THEN the system SHALL provide clear status information
4. IF any service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup
5. WHEN the system is ready THEN it SHALL display the correct access URLs for RunPod

### Requirement 3: Fix Service Integration and Communication

**User Story:** As a user of the voice AI system, I want seamless voice conversations where my speech is converted to text, processed by AI, and responded to with high-quality synthesized speech, so that I have a natural conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak into the microphone THEN the system SHALL process speech-to-text via Voxtral
2. WHEN text is generated by the LLM THEN it SHALL be sent to Orpheus TTS for speech synthesis
3. WHEN TTS processing completes THEN the audio SHALL be streamed back to the client
4. WHEN audio is generated THEN it SHALL use the ऋतिका voice as default
5. WHEN any step fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback and error reporting

### Requirement 4: Optimize Memory and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient memory usage and proper resource cleanup, so that the system runs reliably on GPU infrastructure without memory leaks or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached efficiently to avoid reloading
2. WHEN GPU memory is allocated THEN it SHALL be managed optimally across all models
3. WHEN services shut down THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper garbage collection
5. WHEN the system runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 5: Simplify Configuration and Remove Redundancy

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a clean, simple configuration structure with no duplicate or conflicting files, so that the system is easy to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN there SHALL be a single source of truth for each setting
2. WHEN deployment scripts are used THEN they SHALL not conflict or duplicate functionality
3. WHEN files are created THEN unnecessary or redundant files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the system starts THEN configuration SHALL be loaded from a clear hierarchy
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the architecture SHALL be easy to understand and trace
