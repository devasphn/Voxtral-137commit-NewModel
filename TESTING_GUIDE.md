## 🧪 TEST 1: AUDIO FEEDBACK LOOP / ECHO CANCELLATION

### **Objective**
Verify that TTS audio playback does NOT trigger false interruptions (echo detection).

### **Test Scenario 1A: Long Response Without Interruption**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "Tell me a detailed story about space exploration with at least 20 sentences"
3. **DO NOT SPEAK** during the entire TTS playback
4. Observe the console logs

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🎵 Processing audio chunk 1 from queue
📥 Pre-loaded audio chunk 2
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 1 with voice 'af_heart'
✅ Completed playing audio chunk 1
🎵 Processing audio chunk 2 from queue
📥 Pre-loaded audio chunk 3
🎵 Using pre-loaded audio for chunk 2
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 2 with voice 'af_heart'
✅ Completed playing audio chunk 2
...
🎵 Audio queue processing completed
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ All audio chunks play completely
- ✅ NO "🛑 USER INTERRUPTION" messages
- ✅ NO "🔇 Ignoring low-energy audio during playback" messages
- ✅ Smooth, continuous playback

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% of audio chunks play without interruption
- Zero false interruptions detected
- Natural speech flow maintained

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If you see "🛑 USER INTERRUPTION" without speaking → Echo cancellation issue
- ❌ If audio stops prematurely → VAD threshold too sensitive
- **Action:** Check speaker volume (reduce if too high), check microphone sensitivity

---

### **Test Scenario 1B: Real User Interruption**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "Count from one to one hundred slowly"
3. Wait for TTS to start playing (after ~3-5 chunks)
4. **SPEAK LOUDLY AND CLEARLY** while TTS is playing
5. Say: "Stop, I have a question"
6. Observe the console logs

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🎵 Processing audio chunk 3 from queue
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 3 with voice 'af_heart'
🛑 USER INTERRUPTION: High-confidence speech detected during playback
🗑️ Cleared 15 pending audio chunks due to user interruption
Speech detected - starting continuous capture
📤 Sending audio chunk 1 (16000 bytes)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Audio stops within <200ms of speaking
- ✅ Console shows "🛑 USER INTERRUPTION: High-confidence speech detected"
- ✅ Pending audio chunks are cleared
- ✅ New speech is captured and processed

**Success Criteria:**
- Interruption detected within 200ms
- Audio stops cleanly
- New input processed correctly
- No audio artifacts or glitches

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If interruption takes >500ms → VAD threshold too high
- ❌ If audio doesn't stop → Interruption logic broken
- **Action:** Check console for error messages, verify WebSocket connection

---

### **Test Scenario 1C: Echo Prevention Threshold Test**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "What is artificial intelligence?"
3. **Increase speaker volume to 80-100%**
4. Do NOT speak during playback
5. Observe console logs

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🎵 Processing audio chunk 1 from queue
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 1 with voice 'af_heart'
🔇 Ignoring low-energy audio during playback (likely echo)
🔇 Ignoring low-energy audio during playback (likely echo)
✅ Completed playing audio chunk 1
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Audio plays completely despite high volume
- ✅ Console shows "🔇 Ignoring low-energy audio" (echo detected but ignored)
- ✅ NO interruptions triggered

**Success Criteria:**
- Audio plays completely even at high volume
- Echo is detected but correctly ignored
- No false interruptions

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If audio is interrupted → Echo cancellation threshold too low
- **Action:** Increase the threshold multiplier in `detectSpeechInBuffer` from 3x to 5x

## 🧪 TEST 2: NATURAL SPEECH FLOW / TTS CONSISTENCY

### **Objective**
Verify that TTS synthesis times are consistent and speech sounds natural.

### **Test Scenario 2A: TTS Synthesis Time Consistency**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
3. Monitor server console for TTS synthesis times

**Expected Server Console Output:**

🎵 TTS synthesis for chunk 2: 92ms (text: "revolutionary technology that uses")
🎵 TTS synthesis for chunk 3: 78ms (text: "quantum mechanics to process")
🎵 TTS synthesis for chunk 4: 105ms (text: "information in fundamentally different")
🎵 TTS synthesis for chunk 5: 89ms (text: "ways than classical computers")
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ TTS synthesis times: 50-150ms per chunk
- ✅ Variance: <100ms between chunks
- ✅ NO outliers >300ms

**Success Criteria:**
- 90% of chunks synthesize in <150ms
- Maximum synthesis time <300ms
- Average synthesis time: 80-120ms

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If synthesis times >500ms → Phonemizer bottleneck
- ❌ If high variance (>200ms) → Chunking optimization needed
- **Action:** Check server logs for phonemizer warnings

---

### **Test Scenario 2B: Natural Speech Perception Test**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "Count from one to twenty"
3. **Listen carefully** to the TTS output
4. Note any perceptible gaps or pauses

**Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Natural rhythm and pacing
- ✅ No robotic word-by-word delivery
- ✅ Imperceptible gaps between chunks

**Success Criteria:**
- Speech sounds natural and human-like
- No noticeable gaps between numbers
- Consistent pacing throughout

**Subjective Quality Assessment:**
- Rate speech naturalness: 1-10 (target: 7+)
- Rate smoothness: 1-10 (target: 8+)
- Rate overall quality: 1-10 (target: 7+)

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If gaps are noticeable → Audio buffering issue
- ❌ If speech sounds robotic → Chunking too aggressive
- **Action:** Check browser console for audio loading delays

---

### **Test Scenario 2C: Pre-loading Effectiveness Test**

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Conversation"
2. Ask: "Tell me about the history of computers"
3. Monitor browser console for pre-loading messages

**Expected Browser Console Output:**
```
🎵 Processing audio chunk 1 from queue
📥 Pre-loaded audio chunk 2
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 1 with voice 'af_heart'
✅ Completed playing audio chunk 1
🎵 Processing audio chunk 2 from queue
📥 Pre-loaded audio chunk 3
🎵 Using pre-loaded audio for chunk 2
🎵 Started playing audio chunk 2 with voice 'af_heart'
✅ Completed playing audio chunk 2
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Every chunk (except first) shows "Using pre-loaded audio"
- ✅ Next chunk is pre-loaded while current chunk plays
- ✅ Minimal delay between chunks (<10ms)

**Success Criteria:**
- 90%+ of chunks use pre-loaded audio
- Pre-loading happens in parallel with playback
- No loading delays between chunks

**If Test Fails:**
- ❌ If chunks are NOT pre-loaded → Pre-loading logic broken
- ❌ If delays between chunks >50ms → Network or decoding issue
- **Action:** Check network tab for audio loading times

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Audio Feedback Loop Still Occurring**

**Symptoms:**
- Audio stops prematurely without user speaking
- Console shows "🛑 USER INTERRUPTION" during playback

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce speaker volume to 50-70%
2. Check microphone sensitivity settings
3. Verify echo cancellation is enabled in browser
4. Increase VAD threshold multiplier (edit line 568 in ui_server_realtime.py)

---

### **Issue: TTS Synthesis Times Still High**

**Symptoms:**
- Server logs show synthesis times >500ms
- Noticeable gaps between chunks

**Solutions:**
1. Check for phonemizer warnings in server logs
2. Verify language code is "a" (American English) in config.yaml
3. Check GPU utilization (should be >50% during synthesis)
4. Verify PyTorch autocast is working (no deprecation warnings)

---

### **Issue: Pre-loading Not Working**

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows "Converting base64 audio" for every chunk
- No "Using pre-loaded audio" messages

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify audio queue is not being cleared prematurely
3. Check network tab for audio loading failures
